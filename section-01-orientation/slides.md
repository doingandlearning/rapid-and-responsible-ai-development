---

## Who Are You?

**Quick check-in:** <span class="fragment">What search or knowledge discovery challenges do you see in your technical systems at Edinburgh?</span>

<span class="fragment">_(Think about your services, documentation, or user support - 30 seconds, then share)_</span>

## The Problem We're Solving

### Traditional Search: Keywords Only

<span class="fragment">**User searches:** "database performance issues"</span>

<span class="fragment">**Traditional results:** Documents containing those exact words</span>

<span class="fragment">**Missing:** Documents about "slow queries", "optimization", "indexing bottlenecks"</span>

---

## The Problem We're Solving

### AI-Powered Search: Understanding Intent

<span class="fragment">**User searches:** "database performance issues"</span>

<span class="fragment">**AI-powered results:** All semantically related content</span>

- <span class="fragment">"Query optimization strategies"</span>
- <span class="fragment">"Slow database troubleshooting"</span>
- <span class="fragment">"Index performance tuning"</span>
- <span class="fragment">"Connection pool configuration"</span>

---

## Real-World Impact

### Think About Your University Users

<span class="fragment">**Student Support:** Help students find relevant resources across all services</span>

<span class="fragment">**Staff Knowledge:** Technical documentation, policies, procedures across departments</span>

<span class="fragment">**Research Support:** Find relevant institutional knowledge and expertise</span>

<span class="fragment">**Compliance:** Navigate complex university regulations and requirements</span>

## Your 3-Day Journey

### 🎯 **Learning Philosophy: We Build Real Things**

<span class="fragment">✅ **No toy examples** - Every exercise uses real data</span>

<span class="fragment">✅ **Learn by doing** - Immediate hands-on with every concept</span>

<span class="fragment">✅ **Real-world context** - Connect to problems you actually face</span>

## The Smart Library Analogy

<span class="fragment">Imagine the **perfect librarian** who:</span>

- <span class="fragment">**Understands context** - knows "car troubles" relates to "automotive repair"</span>
- <span class="fragment">**Has perfect memory** - instantly recalls every relevant document</span>
- <span class="fragment">**Synthesizes information** - combines multiple sources into clear answers</span>
- <span class="fragment">**Never sleeps** - available 24/7 for any query</span>

<span class="fragment">**That's what we're building with PostgreSQL + LLMs**</span>

---

## System Architecture Overview

```
📝 Documents → 🧠 Embeddings → 🗄️ PostgreSQL → 🔍 Search → 🤖 LLM → ✨ Answer
```

<span class="fragment">**Real-world equivalent:**</span>

- <span class="fragment">📝 **Documents**: Your company's knowledge base</span>
- <span class="fragment">🧠 **Embeddings**: "Understanding" in mathematical form</span>
- <span class="fragment">🗄️ **PostgreSQL**: Reliable, familiar database with vector superpowers</span>
- <span class="fragment">🔍 **Search**: Find semantically similar content</span>
- <span class="fragment">🤖 **LLM**: Generate human-like responses from context</span>

---

## Why This Tech Stack?

### **PostgreSQL + pgvector**

<span class="fragment">✅ **Familiar**: You already know SQL</span>
<span class="fragment">✅ **Reliable**: Battle-tested in production</span>
<span class="fragment">✅ **Integrated**: Vectors + relational data + JSON in one place</span>

### **Ollama (Local Embeddings)**

<span class="fragment">✅ **Privacy**: Sensitive data never leaves your network</span>
<span class="fragment">✅ **Cost**: No per-token charges</span>
<span class="fragment">✅ **Control**: You own the embedding process</span>

---

## Ground Rules for Success

### **Active Participation**

<span class="fragment">✋ **Ask questions immediately** - If you're confused, others are too</span>

<span class="fragment">💻 **Code along** - Type every example, don't just watch</span>

<span class="fragment">🤝 **Pair up** - Two brains are better than one</span>

### **Growth Mindset**

<span class="fragment">🧠 **"I don't know yet"** instead of "I don't know"</span>

<span class="fragment">🔧 **Debugging is learning** - Errors are opportunities</span>
