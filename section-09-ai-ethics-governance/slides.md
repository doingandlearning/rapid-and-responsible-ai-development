## Why AI Ethics & Governance Matter

### Beyond Technical Implementation

---

**Technical success ≠ Ethical success**

Your production vector search system can:
- Serve thousands of users efficiently
- Provide accurate, relevant results
- Scale across Edinburgh's campuses

---

But can it:
- Ensure fair access for all users?
- Protect privacy and maintain trust?
- Operate transparently and accountability?
- Align with university values and mission?

---

## The Stakes for Universities

### Institutional Responsibility

---

**Edinburgh University Context:**
- 50,000+ students and staff from diverse backgrounds
- Sensitive academic and personal data
- Public sector accountability requirements
- Research integrity and academic freedom principles
- Long-term institutional reputation

---

**One biased search result can:**
- Affect academic opportunities unfairly
- Undermine trust in university systems
- Create legal and regulatory compliance issues
- Damage institutional reputation for decades

---

## Interactive Activity: Stakeholder Impact Analysis

**Scenario:** A biased search result affects a student's course selection

---

## Stakeholder Role Assignment

**Instructions:**
- <span class="fragment">Form pairs</span>
- <span class="fragment">Each pair takes one stakeholder perspective:</span>
  - <span class="fragment">Student affected by bias</span>
  - <span class="fragment">Academic advisor</span>
  - <span class="fragment">University administrator</span>
  - <span class="fragment">IT system developer</span>
  - <span class="fragment">University reputation manager</span>

---

## Discussion Questions

**For your stakeholder, consider:**
- <span class="fragment">How does this bias affect your stakeholder?</span>
- <span class="fragment">What are the short-term vs long-term impacts?</span>
- <span class="fragment">What actions should your stakeholder take?</span>

---

## Group Sharing

**Instructions:**
- <span class="fragment">Each pair shares their stakeholder's perspective</span>
- <span class="fragment">Discuss how these impacts interconnect</span>

---

## What is AI Ethics in Practice?

### Moving Beyond Principles to Implementation

---

**Not just "be good"** - but systematic approaches to the following:

---

- **Fairness:** Ensuring AI systems don't discriminate or create unfair advantages
- **Transparency:** Making AI decisions explainable and auditable
- **Accountability:** Clear responsibility chains for AI-driven outcomes
- **Privacy:** Protecting personal data and respecting user autonomy
- **Reliability:** Ensuring AI systems perform consistently and safely
- **Human oversight:** Maintaining meaningful human control over critical decisions

## Understanding AI Bias in University Systems

### Where Bias Enters Vector Search Systems

**Training Data Bias:**
- Historical documents may reflect past inequities
- Underrepresentation of certain groups or perspectives
- Language biases embedded in source materials

---

**Algorithm Design Bias:**
- Similarity metrics that favor certain writing styles
- Ranking algorithms that perpetuate existing patterns
- Feature selection that disadvantages specific content

---

**Usage Pattern Bias:**
- Different departments having unequal search success
- Campus-specific advantages in content discovery
- Role-based differences in result relevance

---

## Real-World Bias Examples

### University Search System Scenarios

---

**Scenario 1: Academic Search Bias**
- Search for "leadership opportunities" returns mostly male-authored content
- Historical bias in leadership documentation affects current results
- Impact: Female students see fewer role models and opportunities

---

**Scenario 2: Departmental Content Bias**
- IT Services documents consistently rank higher than Student Services
- Result: Students struggle to find support resources they need
- Cause: IT Services documents are more technical, match embedding patterns better

---

**Scenario 3: Campus Location Bias**
- King's Buildings content dominates results for scientific queries
- Other campuses' research becomes harder to discover
- Impact: Reduced collaboration and resource sharing across campuses

---

## Bias Detection and Measurement

### Systematic Approaches to Finding Bias

---

**Quantitative Measures:**

```python
# Example bias detection for university search
def detect_demographic_bias(search_results, queries):
    """Analyze search results for demographic representation."""
    
    bias_metrics = {
        'author_gender_distribution': analyze_author_demographics(search_results),
        'department_representation': measure_departmental_coverage(search_results),
        'campus_balance': assess_campus_distribution(search_results),
        'content_type_fairness': evaluate_content_type_balance(search_results)
    }
    
    return bias_metrics

def fairness_audit(user_queries, system_responses):
    """Regular fairness auditing of search system."""
    
    # Test queries across protected characteristics
    protected_groups = ['gender', 'ethnicity', 'disability', 'age']
    
    for group in protected_groups:
        group_results = test_group_specific_queries(group)
        fairness_score = calculate_fairness_metrics(group_results)
        
        if fairness_score < FAIRNESS_THRESHOLD:
            trigger_bias_mitigation_protocol(group, group_results)
```

---

## Interactive Activity: Hands-on Bias Analysis

- What data is collected and how it's used

---

## Implementing Transparency

### Practical Approaches for University Systems

---

**1. Result Explanations:**
```python
class TransparentSearchResponse:
    def __init__(self, query, results, explanations):
        self.query = query
        self.results = results
        self.explanations = {
            'ranking_factors': self.explain_ranking_factors(),
            'data_sources': self.identify_content_sources(), 
            'confidence_levels': self.provide_confidence_metrics(),
            'bias_considerations': self.highlight_potential_biases()
        }
    
    def explain_ranking_factors(self):
        """Explain why results are ordered as they are."""
        return {
            'similarity_score': 0.7,
            'recency_bonus': 0.1, 
            'department_match': 0.1,

        }
```

---

**2. System Documentation:**

## Case Study: Edinburgh Implementation

### Real-World Application of Ethics Framework

---

**Challenge:** Implementing ethical vector search for 50,000+ university community members

---

**Approach:**
1. **Stakeholder Engagement:** Students, staff, faculty input on ethics priorities
2. **Risk Assessment:** Comprehensive evaluation of bias and privacy risks
3. **Technical Implementation:** Bias detection, transparency features, privacy controls
4. **Governance Structure:** Ethics committee, working groups, clear accountabilities
5. **Continuous Monitoring:** Automated systems + human oversight + community feedback

---

**Results:**
- 95% user trust rating in AI system fairness
- Zero significant privacy incidents in first year
- 15% improvement in search result equity across demographics
- Model for other UK universities implementing ethical AI

---

## Common Challenges and Solutions

### Learning from Implementation Experience

---

**Challenge 1: Balancing Ethics with Performance**
- **Problem:** Bias mitigation sometimes reduces search accuracy
- **Solution:** Multi-objective optimization balancing fairness and relevance
- **Learning:** Perfect fairness may not always be optimal; aim for substantial improvement

---

**Challenge 2: User Understanding of AI Ethics**
- **Problem:** Community members unclear about AI ethics importance
- **Solution:** Regular education, clear communication, practical examples
- **Learning:** Ethics training must be ongoing, not one-time


---

**Challenge 3: Resource Constraints**
- **Problem:** Comprehensive ethics implementation requires significant resources
- **Solution:** Phased approach, automated systems, shared best practices
- **Learning:** Ethics investment pays off through reduced incidents and increased trust
