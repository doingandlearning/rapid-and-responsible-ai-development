# 🌶️🌶️🌶️ Spicy: Database Setup - Create from Scratch

**"I love to create from scratch and surprise myself"**

This guide gives you skeleton code and creative challenges. Discover your own solutions and push the boundaries!

## Step 1: Design Your Database Architecture

You're building a production-ready RAG system. Think about:

- **Scalability**: How will this handle millions of documents?
- **Performance**: What indexing strategies will you use?
- **Flexibility**: How can you make this work for any domain?
- **Monitoring**: What metrics do you need to track?

### Challenge 1: Advanced Table Design

```python
# services/database_manager.py
import psycopg
import psycopg.extras
import json
import logging
from typing import List, Dict, Any, Optional
from dataclasses import dataclass

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

# TODO: Design your own database configuration system
# TODO: Add environment-based configuration
# TODO: Add connection pooling
# TODO: Add monitoring and metrics

@dataclass
class SearchResult:
    """Design your own search result structure"""
    # TODO: What fields do you need for advanced search?
