## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Slow Response Times

**Symptoms**: Responses take > 5 seconds
**Solutions**:

1. Check HNSW index creation: `SELECT * FROM pg_indexes WHERE tablename = 'student_support_docs';`
2. Verify connection pooling: Monitor database connections
3. Optimize chunk size: Reduce to 600-800 characters
4. Enable query caching for frequent queries

### Issue: Poor Response Quality

**Symptoms**: Responses not relevant or accurate
**Solutions**:

1. Verify document ingestion: Check chunk count and content quality
2. Adjust hybrid search weights: Experiment with vector vs. text balance
3. Review query enhancement logic: Ensure entity extraction working
4. Check source authority weighting in re-ranking

### Issue: Bias in Responses

**Symptoms**: Responses favor certain groups or perspectives  
**Solutions**:

1. Audit training documents for representational bias
2. Enhance bias detection keywords and patterns
3. Implement fairness constraints in ranking
4. Regular manual review of responses across user groups

### Issue: Frontend Connection Errors

**Symptoms**: API calls failing from frontend
**Solutions**:

1. Verify CORS configuration in FastAPI
2. Check API base URL in frontend configuration
3. Confirm backend health endpoint accessibility
4. Review network/firewall settings

### Issue: Database Connection Issues

**Symptoms**: Backend cannot connect to PostgreSQL
**Solutions**:

1. Verify Docker services running: `docker ps`
2. Check database configuration in config.py
3. Ensure pgvector extension installed: `CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector;`
4. Review connection pool settings
