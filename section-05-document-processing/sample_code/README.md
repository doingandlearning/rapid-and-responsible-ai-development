## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the required dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install PyPDF2 beautifulsoup4 psycopg requests
```

### Running the Examples

1. **Start with the basics:** Run `01_fixed_size_chunking.py` to understand fundamental chunking concepts
2. **Explore advanced strategies:** Try `02_content_aware_chunking.py` for structure-aware processing
3. **Understand metadata:** Run `03_metadata_preservation.py` to see why metadata matters
4. **Handle real documents:** Use `04_document_extraction.py` for multi-format processing
5. **Ensure quality:** Run `05_quality_assessment.py` to learn quality evaluation
6. **Scale up:** Try `06_production_pipeline.py` for production-ready systems

### Customizing the Examples

Each example is designed to be easily customizable:

- **Change chunk sizes:** Modify `chunk_size` and `overlap` parameters
- **Add new document types:** Extend the extraction functions
- **Customize quality metrics:** Adjust the quality assessment criteria
- **Integrate with your data:** Replace sample data with your documents

## üéØ Learning Path

### For Beginners
1. Start with `01_fixed_size_chunking.py` to understand basic concepts
2. Move to `02_content_aware_chunking.py` for advanced techniques
3. Use `03_metadata_preservation.py` to understand metadata importance

### For Intermediate Users
1. Run `04_document_extraction.py` to handle real documents
2. Use `05_quality_assessment.py` to evaluate your chunking
3. Try `06_production_pipeline.py` for scalable solutions

### For Advanced Users
1. Modify the examples to fit your specific use case
2. Integrate with your existing document processing pipeline
3. Extend the quality metrics for your domain
4. Optimize performance for your scale requirements

## üîß Integration with Lab Solutions

These sample code examples complement the lab solutions in the `solution/` folder:

- **Sample code** shows concepts in isolation with clear explanations
- **Lab solutions** provide complete, integrated implementations
- **Use sample code** to understand individual concepts
- **Use lab solutions** to see how everything works together

## üìö Additional Resources

- **Slides:** Refer to `slides.md` for the theoretical background
- **Lab README:** Check `README.md` for hands-on exercises
- **Solution files:** Use `solution/` folder for complete implementations

## ü§ù Contributing

Feel free to extend these examples with:
- New document formats
- Additional quality metrics
- Performance optimizations
- Integration patterns
- Error handling improvements

## üìù Notes

- All examples use sample data and can be run without external dependencies (except for the production pipeline)
- The production pipeline example requires a running PostgreSQL database with pgvector
- Examples are designed to be educational and may need modification for production use
- Error handling is simplified for clarity - production code should be more robust
