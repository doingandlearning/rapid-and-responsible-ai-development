## How to Use These Solutions

### **For Learning**
1. **Try the lab first** - Don't look at solutions immediately
2. **Use hints** - Check the hints in each solution file
3. **Compare approaches** - See how your solution differs from the examples
4. **Understand trade-offs** - Each approach has different benefits

### **For Reference**
1. **Check specific parts** - Look at individual solution files as needed
2. **Copy patterns** - Use code patterns, not entire solutions
3. **Adapt to your needs** - Modify solutions for your specific use case
4. **Learn best practices** - Focus on the principles, not just the code

### **For Troubleshooting**
1. **Check error handling** - See how solutions handle common errors
2. **Verify data flow** - Trace through the complete pipeline
3. **Test edge cases** - See how solutions handle unusual inputs
4. **Debug step by step** - Use the verification functions

## Key Learning Points

### **Document Processing**
- **Text extraction** requires handling multiple formats and cleaning
- **Chunking strategies** have different trade-offs for different document types
- **Quality assessment** helps identify optimal parameters
- **Metadata preservation** is crucial for user trust and attribution

### **Database Integration**
- **Vector storage** requires proper schema design and indexing
- **Embedding generation** needs error handling and retry logic
- **Batch processing** improves performance and reliability
- **Verification** ensures data integrity and system health

### **Production Considerations**
- **Error handling** prevents data loss and system failures
- **Performance optimization** improves user experience
- **Testing** ensures reliability and quality
- **Monitoring** helps identify issues early

## Common Issues & Solutions

### **Text Extraction Problems**
```python
# Problem: Empty or malformed pages
# Solution: Check for empty content and handle gracefully
if not text.strip():
    continue  # Skip empty pages
```

### **Chunking Quality Issues**
```python
# Problem: Broken sentences
# Solution: Check sentence boundaries
if not text[-1] in '.!?':
    # Handle broken sentence
```

### **Database Connection Issues**
```python
# Problem: Connection failures
# Solution: Implement retry logic
for attempt in range(max_retries):
    try:
        # Database operation
        break
    except Exception as e:
        if attempt == max_retries - 1:
            raise
        time.sleep(1)
```

### **Embedding Generation Failures**
```python
# Problem: Ollama service unavailable
# Solution: Implement fallback and retry
if not embedding:
    print("⚠️  Embedding failed, using placeholder")
    embedding = [0.0] * 1024  # Placeholder
```
