## Why Semantic Chunking?

Most naïve document splitters use fixed token windows (e.g. 500 tokens with 50-token overlap). This is simple and predictable, but it ignores meaning. A window may slice through the middle of a paragraph, a table, or a definition, producing fragments that are semantically incomplete. That reduces retrieval accuracy and increases the chance of hallucinations.

**Semantic chunking** uses NLP models (sentence embeddings, similarity analysis, topic segmentation) to place boundaries at _natural breaks in meaning_. Instead of saying “every 500 tokens is a new chunk,” it asks “where does the text naturally shift topic?” The result is chunks that are internally coherent and externally distinct.

## Advantages

- **Topic-aware boundaries**: Chunks align with how humans naturally segment text — sections, definitions, examples.
- **Better recall & relevance**: Queries are more likely to retrieve chunks that directly answer them, because chunks contain whole thoughts.
- **Natural information grouping**: Sections like “Methods,” “Results,” or “Conclusion” stay intact.
- **Improved user trust**: Retrieved passages read cleanly, without abrupt cuts.

## Disadvantages

- **Complexity**: Requires embedding models and similarity scoring, not just string splitting.
- **Unpredictable sizes**: Chunks can vary; some long topics may exceed the ideal window, some may be short.
- **Processing cost**: More compute upfront — every paragraph needs an embedding, boundaries must be detected.
- **Tuning required**: Thresholds for “semantic breaks” differ across document types (academic papers vs. manuals vs. code docs).

## Practical Notes for RAG

- Use semantic chunking for **knowledge-dense, long-form texts** (papers, policies, manuals).
- Fall back to fixed-window or hybrid approaches for **structured data** (tables, JSON, code).
- Consider a **two-stage strategy**: semantic segmentation first, then apply token-based splitting inside very large sections.
- Evaluate with **Recall\@K** on a held-out Q\&A set — measure if semantically chunked corpora actually improve retrieval over fixed windows.
